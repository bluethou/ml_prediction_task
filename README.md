predicting time-series data with large size of categorical features. I mainly used categorical embedding by Tensorflow, as well as PCA to describe feature importance

Files description
- EDAreport.html: EDA report generated by R summarytools library. One should download to visaulize the html result.
- category_embedding_validation.ipynb: the main modeling code with comments. It mainly use Tensorflow
- feature_importance.xlsx: feature importance tables written in Excel. Explaination included.
- prediction_result.csv: Prediction result with ID column and probability to be labeled as one.
